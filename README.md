# Random-Number-Gusser-Using-C-
During my journey through the Codsoft Internship, the first task I was assigned was to make a Random Number Guesser Game using C++. I used multiple if-else statements to identify if the user has found the number has guessed more than the number, or is still short on his guess. I implemented a counter to identify the number of guesses throughout the processâ€”difficulty: Easy.
